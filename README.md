# Employee-Tracker-Program

## Description

This program I've created is a quick and easy way to track and add new and existing employees to your database. Within this program you will be able to view all your departments, roles and employees as well as you can add a new department, role and employee! This program makes managing your employee database clean and efficient. 

## Usage

To run the program all you need to do is run a "npm start" and you will be prompted with questions of what you would like to do. When you select a given question then more questions will be asked in terms of what you want to do wether it may be, adding a department a role or an employee.

## Features

What is really handy about this program is that it will keep track of all the new departments and roles you make for as long as you have this running. Also I have added color text to some of the console text so you can easily decipher whats going on. Console table is also being used here so that the data is easily readable.
